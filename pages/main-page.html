    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am a programmer who is focused primarily on program design and finding ways to apply math to real life via programming.  This site currently exists as a small sort-of portfolio for job interviewing.</p>
<p>I intend to add instructional content relating to various things that I have learned and/or things that I feel need to be better explained to others.  At the moment there is a single article and video related to a concept known as multiple dispatch.  The next articles/videos I create will be focused on the applications of k-means clustering related algorithms, simple algorithms for basic counting (combinations/permutations) with some example applications, and applying the binomial probability distribution to various things.</p>
<p>As for myself, I have been a caregiver, public school teacher, and software developer.  My current interests are family, fitness, learning, teaching, and making things (music, tutorials, this blog, etc).  My biggest guilty pleasure is, has, and likely will always be video games.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me via e-mail at douglas.a.thompson@gmail.com</p>
